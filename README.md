# petfabula_client
a close business level social media app client side
project structured with monorepo style

## technical stack
react, react-native, react-redux, axios etc.

## notice
UI logic and state management are decupled using custom hooks.
Also I actually designed my own redux architecture and built my own "redux-tools". So that I can make it easier to deal with async action and states, along with middlewares common effects etc.
